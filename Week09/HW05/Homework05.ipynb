    "1. From what s/he knows about the equipment used to measure the resonant frequency, your lab partner hastily estimates the uncertainty in the measurement of $f$ to be $\\sigma(f) = 0.01$ MHz. Estimate the probability that the straight line you found is an adequate description of the observed data if it is distributed with the uncertainty guessed by your lab partner. (Hint: use scipy.stats.chi2 class to compute the quantile of the chi2 distribution).  What can you conclude from these results? \n",

    "1. Assume that the best-fit line found in Part 1 is a good fit to the data. Estimate the uncertainty in measurement of $y$ from the scatter of the observed data about this line. Again, assume that all the data points have equal weight. Use this to estimate the uncertainty in both the slope and the intercept of the best-fit line. This is the technique you will use in the Optical Pumping lab to determine the uncertainties in the fit parameters.\n",
    "1. Now assume that the uncertainty in each value of $f$ grows with $f$: $\\sigma(f) = 0.03 + 0.03 * f$ (MHz). Determine the slope and the intercept of the best-fit line using the least-squares method with unequal weights (weighted least-squares fit)\n"
