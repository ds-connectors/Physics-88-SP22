The equation for an N-sphere is $x_1^2 +x_2^2 +x_3^2 + ... + x_N^2 \\le r^2$ (where $x_i$ are spatial coordinates in $N$ dimensions).

Write a function that uses Monte Carlo integration to estimate $\\alpha_N$ and its uncertainty for a fixed $N$. Graph $\\alpha_N$ with its uncertainty as a function of $N$ for $N=4$ ... $10$. "

    "If you're having trouble getting started, we did the $N = 2$ case in Workshop 8.  To use this method of MC integration, start by generating a large number (something like $10000$) of points randomly scattered in some region of $N-$dimensional space.  I say \"some region\", because you may choose to sample points from the range $(0,1)$ or the range $(-1, 1)$ along each dimension.  I prefer to use `np.random.rand()`, which samples uniformly from the range $(0,1)$ and scale things appropriately (this choice of range required us to multiply by $4$ to estimate $\\pi$ in WS8; and of course this scale factor depends on $N$ !).\n",

    "Then you just need to count up the number of these random points that satisfy the $N-$sphere condition given above (it's easiest just to take $r=1$).  The fraction of points within the $N-$sphere can be used to estimate $\\alpha_N$.  You could repeat this procedure many times to estimate the uncertainty in each $\\alpha_N$ or you may find it faster to use an analytical formula for the error (see lecture notes on statistics `lec05_stat.pdf` or MC `lec06_MC.pdf` in bCourses)."
